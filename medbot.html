      <p> MedBot was a project worked on by two other students and myself at Hack.UVa, a hackathon held at our school. MedBot was an iOS chat bot application that could be used to diagnose medical situations and provide relevant treatment information. It also had a built in feature using the SafeTrek API, where specific authorities (medical, police, fire) could be alerted depending on the situation. The need for such an application arose from a situation where someone at our fraternity's party had too much to drink and was exhibiting potential symptoms of alcohol poisoning. Thankfully, the president of our fraternity knew proper medical procedure for the given situation and the student received the proper treatment, but it led us to design a product for those that may not have that medical knowledge.
      </p>
      <p> This application was one of the winners for "Best Use of the SafeTrek API", and the team was very proud with the finished product. Unfortunately, it is not available on the App Store.
