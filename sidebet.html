      <p> SideBet was a fun side project that I worked on during the summer of 2017. It was planned to be an online platform for individuals to create and place custom bets to the service, and other users could look through the created bets and choose to accept one if they felt inclined to do so. Each bet consisted of a title, a description, odds, and amount gambled. This would allow users to customize and create any sort of bet for any amount, much like groups of friends do by word of mouth. I thought this would be a cool project to work on because my friends and I were into sports betting at the time, and I thought it would be convenient to design a service so we didn't have to call or text each other in order to make a bet.

        The legality of this service was never taken into account because the site was never expected to go live to the public. It was predominantly a project I designed and implemented to help me learn PHP and SQL injection.
